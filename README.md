# User Management project

This project is a user management interface built with React and TypeScript that fetches and displays a list of users from the JSONPlaceholder API. It features a dynamic table where users can search and filter results in real-time, leveraging Redux Toolkit for state management to handle user data and filter states efficiently. The design incorporates Tailwind CSS for general styling, while SCSS is used for a custom loader, enhancing the loading experience. To ensure smooth visual transitions, Animate.css has been integrated for added animations.
